Hi, I make software for a hobby. Most of my experience is in C#, but I have made smaller projects in Python and Java, as well as websites using HTML, JS, and CSS, with a bit of PHP in the mix.

Always looking for ways to improve my code.

## Website progress
Tasks to do:
- [ ] About Me page
- [ ] TS page
- [ ] Projects page
- [ ] Navigation (added to each page via jQuery)
- [ ] Ensure all pages work for mobile users. Webkit is fun, for those who aren't aware of it. /s
- [ ] Footer for each page (show authorship/last updated/page source)
- [ ] Find a way to make tables work on mobile
- [ ] Contact page?

### To be added
- SimSig Simulation Picker (already done)
- AP Preload Name Shortener (already done)

### WIP
These will probably be added to my repos as open-source releases. Maybe.
Either since these are WIP or I'm just uncertain on whether to add them. Because that's admittedly what I'm like.
- TS Readme Maker + Scenario Packager (almost done, completely functional with a few bugs)
- Fen Line Installer (will not include the route itself, but the installer will potentially be open-source)
- Duff Gen Maker (just a fun console line program to be converted to HTML/JS)
- HellfireMiles (mostly functioning with a few incomplete parts and bugs)
- Pokedex Webscraper (personal project to be made open-source, title TBA)

### Discord bots
The source code for my Discord bots that may be released as open-source, obviously with tokens etc. redacted
- Coastway Will Server Bot (includes things like message starring [still a WIP] and ability to run a guess the station game)
- SimSig Game Updates (webscraper that posts game updates at 00:00 each day)
- Train Sim TV Bot (from 2019, a bot for a defunct server that posts stream schedule updates - currently only via Discord but may be made remote eventually)

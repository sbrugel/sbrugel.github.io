### already done, will be added
- SimSig Simulation Picker (already done)
- AP Preload Name Shortener (already done)

### to be added
These will probably be added to my repos as open-source releases. Maybe.
Either since these are WIP or I'm just uncertain on whether to add them. Because that's admittedly what I'm like.
- TS Readme Maker + Scenario Packager (almost done, completely functional with a few bugs)
- Fen Line Installer (will not include the route itself, but the installer will potentially be open-source)
- Duff Gen Maker (just a fun console line program to be converted to HTML/JS)
- HellfireMiles (mostly functioning with a few incomplete parts and bugs)
- Pokedex Webscraper (personal project to be made open-source, title TBA)

			<p>My biggest hobbies are computer-centric. I'm an avid gamer, with my main favorite genres being strategy, simulation, and sandbox. Of course, I enjoy other things, too! They are listed below.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>As you have probably seen, I also enjoy developing projects. Currently, I work as a manager of the college's computer science department's official Discord server, maintaining the server itself as well
                as its custom-made bot, <a href="https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2">Sage.</a></p>
            <p>My main programming/markdown
                languages are C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, and Python. Especially since I am a 
                college student enrolled within the Computer Science major, I can't wait to learn more about many things in my field. For more information on my works and involvements, please view 
            the <i>Projects</i> page.</p>
            <p>I have also familiarized myself with Blender (for 3D asset creation) and the Unity game engine. However, while I do have a bit of experience in modelling, it is not 
                something I actively pursue.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>If any unusual or otherwise uncommon fixation defines me, it's trains. They're something I've been interested in for years, having learned the ins and outs of them, from 
                routes to timetables to train types, I developed scenarios and patches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator_2022/">
                Train Simulator</a> though this is something from the past that I am not as involved in. You can view my releases in the <i>Game Content</i> page.
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy photography whenever I get the chance. Of course, trains are mainly what I photograph. Eventually, I hope 
                to get into more general photography, such as that of nature. I've uploaded many of my high-resolution pictures to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/183445295@N08/">Flickr</a>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Another one of my hobbies is playing music, with my primary instrument being the trombone. I was in my high school's marching band, which actively performed at 
                football games and competitively as part of the <a href="https://cavalcadeofbands.com/">Cavalcade of Bands</a>, a competitive band circuit based in southeastern 
                Pennsylvania. That time was one of the most enjoyable I had, having met many friends, an awesome band director, and, on a large stage, performing something that 
                I may never have the opportunity to do again.</p>
                <p>I was also involved in my high school's wind ensemble, jazz band, pep band, and for my senior year, a mini-ensemble that covered 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LuckyChops">Lucky Chops</a> songs over Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Some other hobbies I have include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Biking. I enjoy going on bike rides whenever it's nice out, whether for a brief jaunt or a long trip.</li>
                <li>Learning German.</li>
                <li>Video editing.</li>
                <li>Driving my car, especially to places I have never been to before.</li>
                <li>Listening to all sorts of music. D&B, electronic and rock are my favorite genres.</li>
            </ul>

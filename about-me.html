        My biggest hobbies are tech-centric. I'm a software/web developer, first
        and foremost, with my main languages being C#, Java, C, C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. Frameworks I know include .NET and React.
        I also know a bit of 3D modelling via Blender.

        I have various other interests, including:

              I'm super into simulation, strategy, platformer, RPG, and
              roguelike games. Favorite games include Risk of Rain 2, XCOM 2, Civilization V, among others.

              I'm a massive transport and train nerd. You can ask me a question
              about American, British, or German trains, mainly regarding train
              types, timetables, infrastructure, and I'd <i>probably</i> be able
              to give you a quick answer.

              I'm a hobbyist photographer, with the main subject of my photos
              being trains! How surprising. Eventually, I hope to delve into
              more general areas of photography, such as nature. You can view my
              photos on

              Both playing and listening to - I have 10 years of experience with the trombone, having participated in wind ensemble, and jazz/marching band in my grade school years.
              My favorite genres of music to listen to include alt rock and different types of electronic (drum & bass being on top).

              Ich kann ein bisse Deutsch sprechen. Ich lerne Deutsch durch
              Duolingo und meine Universität weil ich Deutschland besuchen
              möchte! Deutsch ist sehr toll!
            </p>

              I'm also interested in learning about German culture. I was
              exposed to it in an introductory German class at college, and it
              is truly fascinating.

              about history.

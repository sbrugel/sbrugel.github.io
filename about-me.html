        My biggest hobbies are tech-centric. I'm a software/web developer, first
        and foremost. (In an alternate universe, I'd probably have become a
        graphic designer.) Currently, I help maintain the University of Delaware
        Computer & Information Sciences department's Discord server, including
        its custom-made bot,
        <a href="https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2">Sage,</a> I'm an
        undergrad contributor for human-computer interaction-related research at
        college, and I'm an intern software developer who works with JavaScript and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember, having
        played video games a lot as a kid. I started programming with Java in
        2015, and I've learnt a lot since. I'm proficient in C#, HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, and Python. I also know a bit of C and
        Node.js and am currently learning C++, Assembly, and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a bit of 3D modelling experience using Blender, but it's not
        something I actively pursue. I also have worked with the Unity game
        engine, though my forte in that regard is scripting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have various other interests outside of development. These include:

              I'm super into simulation, strategy, platformer, RPG, and
              roguelike games. Favorite games include Risk of Rain 2, XCOM 2, Civilization V, among others.

              I'm a massive transport and train nerd. You can ask me a question
              about American, British, or German trains, mainly regarding train
              types, timetables, infrastructure, and I'd <i>probably</i> be able
              to give you a quick answer.

              I'm a hobbyist photographer, with the main subject of my photos
              being trains! How surprising. Eventually, I hope to delve into
              more general areas of photography, such as nature. You can view my
              photos on

              Both playing and listening to! I have 10 years of experience with
              the trombone under my belt, being in my high school's marching
              band, which performed at football games and in competitions. Those
              were some of my most enjoyable years of grade school, without a
              doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also played for my high school's wind ensemble, jazz band, pep
              band, and for my senior year, a mini-ensemble that covered
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LuckyChops"
                >Lucky Chops songs</a
              >
              over Zoom during COVID-19.

            <p>
              I love listening to rock and electronic music. Appropriately,
              Pendulum is my favorite band. I'm surprised I discovered them as
              late as high school, considering their mix of genres suits my
              tastes perfectly!

              Ich kann ein bisse Deutsch sprechen. Ich lerne Deutsch durch
              Duolingo und meine Universität weil ich Deutschland besuchen
              möchte! Deutsch ist sehr toll!

              I'm also interested in learning about German culture. I was
              exposed to it in an introductory German class at college, and it
              is truly fascinating.

              Canoeing/kayaking, biking, watching TV (top shows are Let's Make a
              Deal, Futurama, and Whose Line is it Anyway?), mini-golfing, hiking, roller coasters, and reading
              about history (I'd strongly recommend Peter Frankopan's <i>The Silk Roads</i> if you want a great read).

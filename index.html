        <p>
          Hello, the name's Simon. I'm a sophomore computer science major at the
          University of Delaware with a strong interest in software and web
          development. Besides programming, I have a wide array of other
          interests, all detailed below!
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Languages</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I started development as a hobby in 2015, and since then, I've learned
          many different languages, whether through my own learning, high
          school/college classes, or work experience. Click on the dropdowns to
          view more about the languages I've used so far.

          <p class="collapsible-text">Java</p>
        </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="collapsible-text">
            Java was the first language I learned, way back in 2015 when I was
            in middle school, having used numerous books I'd borrow from the
            library. From a simple "Hello World!" program, to terminal-based
            games demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts, to GUI
            utilities and games using Swing, my experience with Java is the
            foundation of the experience I have today. Java is a weird language
            for sure, but it remains an important part of my journey as a
            developer.

          <p class="collapsible-text">Python</p>
        </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="collapsible-text">
            Python was the second language I learned, having started writing
            programs in it in 2016 using a college-level textbook (I was 14 at
            the time!). I learned the syntax and made some basic GUI apps using
            a library provided with the book, and eventually I made utilities of
            varying scales (a script that finds lengthy lines in text files, a
            random list selector...) and even a couple of games using the Pygame
            and Designer.py libraries. More recently, I started working with
            PIL, a powerful image-manipulation library for the language, having
            created dynamic graphs and visualizations of interactions with
            physical devices.<br /><br />Unfortunately, thus far, I've not done
            as much as Python as I'd like to have done. But hopefully, plenty of
            opportunities will arise with my college career - and of course, I'm
            willing to learn more about it on my own!

            C#, personally, is my favorite language, and the one I am most
            comfortable with. With certainty, I can say it's a million times
            better than Java!<br /><br />I started programming in it around
            2018. Most of my projects in this language are GUI applications,
            including a desktop journal keeper, study helper that allows users
            to create their own flash card sets and quiz themselves on them,
            custom-built, sophisticated game content installers, and
            applications that display local CSV game data in numerous, organized
            formats.<br /><br />Additionally, I've worked with the
            Unity 3D game engine, which uses C# for scripting, mainly in the
            areas of just component scripting and UI design.

            What more can I say? These two languages are what make up the
            majority of this website. Having started with basic HTML elements as
            well as learning tidbits of CSS at a time (also throwing in a very
            small amount of JavaScript), only in the past couple of years have I
            realized how powerful those three languages combined are. That
            realization helped stimulate my interest in full-stack web
            development, but that's a story for the JavaScript panel below.

            One of the more recent languages I've learned that have proved very
            valuable to my career as a developer. I taught myself JS at first,
            having made numerous projects on different mediums, from web-based
            3D games to Discord bots for smaller servers. For a little while, I
            migrated to TypeScript (a subset of this language, more detail
            below) before returning to JavaScript to learn the React web
            framework. Initially, I took a disliking to it, but the experience I
            gained in it from a summer internship was absolutely invaluable -
            I've since grown a liking towards function/state-based React. Since
            then, I've made frontend and full-stack web applications using the
            framework.

          <p class="collapsible-text">
            When I was a college freshman, some friends introduced me to
            TypeScript, a subset of JavaScript that contains strict typing and
            principles more closely related to object-oriented programming,
            along many other changes. Initially, I disliked it, but as I worked
            collaboratively with other undergrads on a bot for the University of
            Delaware's official Computer Science Discord server over a winter
            semester, I gained a strong liking for it - a preference for it over
            vanilla JS, even! I've since used it extensively on web scrapers and
            other Discord bots, such as one that tracks the SEPTA trains I take
            to and from college, and one that translates user-inputted strings
            and even previously-sent text messages.

            I initially learned C++ in 2016, but dropped it after finding it too
            complicated. I revisited it in my sophomore year of college,
            primarily for a Data Structures class, and I since gained a strong
            liking for it. Simply put, it's flexible, powerful, fast, and
            dynamic. So far I've learned a lot about managing memory and data,
            including data structures (trees and hashmaps) and sorting
            algorithms, all of which crucial parts of every area of software
            development.

            C is an interesting language for sure. I learned it through a

            was a lot easier to learn than I thought it would be! Many of the
            projects I worked on in this language interface with my Raspberry
            Pi, displaying different things on a sense hat.

            operations, branching/loops, managing the stack, and arrays.<br /><br />Assembly
            is far from my favorite language to work with. However, I haven't
            ruled out low-level programming as an interest of mine yet, so who

                    Originally created in 2021, this is a Discord bot that
                    fetches from the SEPTA API every 2 minutes and returns
                    delays, last recorded location, and train consist
                    information for user-inputted train numbers in a specified
                    text channel. It also regularly updates users on
                    alerts/advisories for regional rail lines.

                    Based on known grades/weights and the weight of an unknown
                    grade, this Python script calculates the unknown grade
                    needed to get a target final grade, as well as the
                    highest/lowest possible grades that can be achieved, and a
                    programatically-generated graph that shows the final grade
                    that will be achieved based on the value of the unknown
                    grade.

			<p class="bigtext"><i><b><u>Welcome to my new website!</u></b></i></p>
			<p>This is the new home for content that was previously found on www.cynxs-stuff.com. I simply wanted a sort of a fresh start on building a site from the ground up,
				but I also wanted a place to easily integrate my open-source personal and academic projects. In a way, you can treat this as my portfolio.</p>
			<p>All existing content from my previous website has been migrated here, including scenarios and software. There will be new additions added over the coming months
				as I polish my projects for release. Keep an eye on my <a href="https://github.com/sbrugel">Github page</a> for more information on that.</p>
			<p>For more information on myself and my experiences, check out the <i>About Me</i> page. A rundown of my developments, with links to download and source code, is located 
				in <i>Projects</i>, while Train Simulator scenarios, reskins, etc. are under <i>Game Content</i>.</p>

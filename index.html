        <b>Welcome</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm Simon. This is my website.</p>
      <p>I'm a second-year college student at the University of Delaware, pursuing a bachelor of science in Computer Science, concentrating in Artifical Intelligence. 
        Currently, I work as an intern web developer, creating applications using JavaScript and React. I also work with other undergraduate students and professors at my college on various projects, including a Discord bot that facilitates learning and bridges professor-student interactions, and on a research project focusing on human-computer interaction.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Many of my personal, software/web development projects are available online. This website's <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> has a run down of my main projects. Their source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/sbrugel">GitHub</a>.</p>
      </p>
      <p>If you are here to download TS Classic scenarios/patches that I've made, they are no longer hosted on this website. All of my TS content has all been migrated to <a>a folder on MediaFire,</a> where you can freely download them like before. <i>All content is legacy and will not be updated to use newer requirements or implement fixes. Do not email me asking for help, it won't be given.</i></p>

			  <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Simon Brugel, a senior computer science undergraduate at the University of Delaware. This website serves as my portfolio, where you'll see my main industry/academic experiences and side projects.</p>
			  <p>My specialty is software engineering, though I have experience in other fields including artificial intelligence/data science, human-computer interaction, systems programming, and DevOps. I'm also open to exploring new fields and applications, and as a very technically-minded person, I can pick up new technologies easily.</p>
			  <p>Currently, I am seeking full-time employment in software engineering, data science, or related fields for after I graduate. Feel free to contact me through any methods on the left!</p>
			  <h3 class="blue"><u>fun facts</u></h3>
			  <ul>
				<li><p>I'm a hobbyist digital artist and collector of train magazines/books</p></li>
				<li><p>I am a huge fan of the Philadelphia Eagles - Go Birds ðŸ¦…</p></li>
				<li><p>My favorite bands include Muse, Linkin Park, Green Day, Foo Fighters, and Pendulum. In recent times, I started <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/sbrugel/collection" class="blue"><u>collecting CDs</u></a> too!</p></li>
				<li><p>I really like dragons</p></li>
